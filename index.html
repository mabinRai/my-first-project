        <p>
          Maharajadhiraja Prithivi Narayan Shah (<strong>1723[3]–1775</strong>;
          Nepali: पृथ्वीनारायण शाह) was the last ruler of the Gorkha Kingdom in
          the Indian subcontinent, present-day Nepal, and first monarch of
          Kingdom of Nepal (also called Kingdom of Gorkha) on the Indian
          subcontinent. He claimed to be a Gorkhali monarch of Rajput origin
          from medieval India. Some people credit Prithvi Narayan Shah for
          starting the campaign for the unification of Nepal, while others feel
          contempt against him for colonization.

          <li>
            As soon as he ascended the throne, the same year he tried to conquer
            Nuwakot. He sent troops under the command of Kazi Biraj Thapa but
            lost.
          </li>

          <li>
            As Kalu Pandey, Prithvi Narayan Shah's Kazi suggested, he recruited
            soldiers from Terai, made his army and trained them in warfare. He
            was far-sighted and clever. So, he made friendly relations with the
            neighboring kingdoms so that they would not attack Gorkha in his
            absence.
          </li>
          <li>
            In<strong>1801</strong>, Prithvi Narayan Shah attacked Nuwakot from
            3 sides and conquered it. He also invaded Belkot, but he had to pay
            a high price of losing many soldiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jayaprakash Malla tried to chase the troops from Nuwakot, but he
            failed. Prithvi Narayan Shah wanted to conquer the Kathmandu valley.
            So, he occupied Naldum and Mahadevpokhari but Jayaprakash Malla
            regained Naldum. Then, Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Lamindada and
            Dolakha.
          </li>
          <li>
            During his unification process, Lamjung and Tanahun together
            attacked Gorkha but both were defeated. King Trivikram Sen of
            Tanahun was arrested.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prithvi Narayan Shah captured Pharping, Bodegaun and Khokana. He
            tried to conquer Kirtipur but he was badly defeated and Kazi Kalu
            Pandey lost his life in the battle. Though he was not discouraged
            and he conquered Shivapuri, Palanchok, Kabhrebot and Kabilaspur in
            the meantime.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to the expansion of Gorkha kingdom in a rapid pace, King
            Digbandhan Sen of Makwanpur became afraid and he joined Jaya Prakash
            Malla. Prithvi Narayan Shah sent troops to Makwanpur. The king of
            Makwanpur, along with his minister, fled away. Makwanpur was also
            captured in <strong>1819 B.S.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>1819 B.S</strong>, Mir Kasim, nawab of Bengal attacked
            Gorkha. The Gorkha troops defeated them and captured their arms and
            ammunitions
          </li>
          <li>
            In Bhadra <strong>1823 B.S</strong>, he tried to invade Kirtipur. He
            lost this time as well making a narrow escape. His commander,
            Surpratap Shah lost his left eye and Daljit Shah was wounded. After
            some months, he again attacked Kirtipur and, this time, he was
            successful.
          </li>
          <li>
            When Gorkhas surrounded Kathmandu valley, Jayprakash Malla feared of
            losing his kingdom. He asked East India Company to send troops. In
            1824, Gorkha soldiers defeated the enemy.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>1825 B.S</strong>, during the festival of Indrajatra,
            Gorkha made an attack from 3 sides. Jayprakash Malla fled to Patan.
            After 11 days of conquering Kathmandu, Patan was also captured. The
            king of Patan, Tej Narsingh and Jayprakash Malla fled to Bhaktapur.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <strong>1826 B.S</strong>, Bhaktapur was also conquered. King
            Ranjit Malla surrendered. In this way, Prithvi Narayan Shah
            conquered the whole valley.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the successful conquest of Kathmandu valley, he conquered
            Kaski, Dhor, Paiyun, Rising and Bhirkot. Then he captured the
            eastern regions like Morang, Chaudandi and Kirant region. In
            <strong>1831 B.S</strong>, he occupied Vijaypur.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <ul>
          Prithvi Narayan Shah wanted more extension. His conquest of Sikkim
          failed as he died on Magh 1, 1831. By this time, he had extended his
          territory up to the Mechi river in the east, Gandaki in the west,
          Tibet to the north and Bihar of India to the south. Prithvi Narayan
          Shah contributed a lot to unite the scattered kingdoms into a greater
          Nepal.
